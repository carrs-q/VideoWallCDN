# VideoWallCDN
## Startup .bad for Windows Computers 
```bad
@echo off
REM echo Questions to gerberm@qut.edu.au
echo Start CDN script
cd "C:\Users\Development\... PATH to CDN"
cmd /k node index.js  
```
## CDN Files
1. create Folder "cdn" in the root directory (is already in gitignore)
2. create Folder in cdn with the project title
3. insert files (names need to fit the given names)

## Clean Up Computer from Files
Unity stores the files in AppData of the current logged in User
These can be removed there
``` C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\LocalLow\CarrsQ\Simulator Video Controll Center``` 

-> Hint for VR: On some Computers the copy-process takes long, because it is copied over the network interface. To skip this process, you can copy the files directly in the folder, which is ways faster
